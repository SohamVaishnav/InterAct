# InterAct 
An efficient, secure and reliable data sharing system between multiple.

## What is it about?
InterAct is a system developed solely for inter-device usage. It allows for sharing data between devices using simple "chat terminal" commands without any hassle. \

## Features
1. Registration of devices
2. Creation of groups
3. Establishing communities contained of multiple groups
It uses (should use) some communication protocol (similar to LAN but you get the point developed ;)). \
4. Enabling two-way transfer of data - accessing data in one device by pinging it and sharing it from there to the operating device
5. Everything to be handled over a custom "InterAct Terminal" which will have these commands in place. 
6. Flexibility in data-sharing - multiple datatypes, data accessibiity across devices owned by a single person (need to figure out a way to establish verification).
